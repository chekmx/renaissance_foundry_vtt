The spell allows the Witch to combine the MAG of all people present in the ceremony to add to another spell, which then becomes more powerful. The spell requires ten minutes of dancing and chanting for every person involved in the ceremony; if the ceremony is interrupted and 10% of those taking part (round down to nearest whole number!) are prevented from chanting, it must be begun again from the beginning. (If the caster of the spell is interrupted, the ceremony must be restarted even if all the others are still taking part). In such a situation, the MAG of those removed from the ceremony will be lost. While the ceremony is taking place, the Witch who is casting the spell must add the ingredients to a cauldron in the centre of the circle of dancers. At the end of the ceremony, the spell roll is made, and if successful, the Witch can then cast any spell she wishes, adding the MAG of all those present to boost its power. See the text box &ldquo;A Ritual for to Call on the Power of a Coven&rdquo; for the incantation that is chanted while the ceremony is going on.</p>\n<p>E.g. Mother Demdike gathers her coven together to cast the spell For to Cause a Great Downpour. She has twelve other Witches with her, who have MAGs of 6, 4, 2, 5, 4, 5, 8, 7, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Her own MAG is 8. This gives her a total of 6+4+2+5+4+5+8+7+3+4+5+6+8=67 MAG to add to the spell.

The model need not be accurate and detailed, but must bear some recognisable similarity to the illusion required. This requires eight hours and a successful Craft skill, appropriate to the material used (clay, wood, stone, weaving, etc). If the Craft skill test is failed, the model is useless, and the spell need not be cast. If the model is made successfully, the Witch may cast the spell at whatever Magnitude she requires, and it will be imbued in the object. Once this charm is made, she can create the illusion simply by touching the object and making a Witchcraft test. The Magnitude of the illusion can never be higher than the Magnitude of the spell cast when the charm was made. If the Witch fumbles while casting the spell, the charm breaks and cannot be used again. The charm can only be used by the Witch who made it.</p>","skill":"Elemental Casting (Air)","area":"0","charm":true,"concentration":false,"distant":false,"duration":"15 Minutes","eyeContact":false,"instant":false,"magnitude":3,"progressive":true,"ranged":true,"resist":"","touch":false,"trigger":false},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[],"_id":"U6Qoavsp7mfx3cRC"}
