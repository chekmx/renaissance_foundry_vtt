Acrobatics: An Athletics test allows a character to perform a variety of gymnastic and balancing tasks, such as tumbling, walking a tightrope or keeping balance on a narrow or unstable ledge. The character can move at half his normal speed across an unstable surface without penalty. To move at a normal rate requires an Athletics test. A successful Acrobatics test will also halve the damage suffered from falling.</p>\n<p>Brute Force: Brute force is a particular application of Athletics that relies purely on power, with no finesse involved. Brute force basically involves pushing, lifting or dragging. Rather than the normal Characteristics, brute force Athletics tests rely on STR+SIZ rather than STR+DEX.</p>\n<p>Climbing: Given adequate time enough hand and footholds, a character can climb any surface without the need for a test. Under normal circumstances, a character can climb or descend one quarter of their Movement as a Combat Action. A&nbsp; Character can double the rate of his climb or descent by taking a &ndash; 20% penalty on his Athletics test.</p>\n<p>Jumping: In general, a successful Athletics test allows a character to jump up to twice his own height horizontally or up to half his own height vertically, if he has at least five metres to run first. If he is making a standing jump, these distances are halved. Penalties for jumping Athletics tests can be accrued by trying to jump further. A cumulative &ndash;20% penalty is bestowed for every extra metre the character is trying to jump.</p>\n<p>Swimming: Characters normally swim at half their usual Movement. Athletics tests are only required when conditions are less than ideal &ndash; swimming while heavily encumbered or in strong currents, for example.</p>","base1":"Strength","base2":"Dexterity","value":0},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}
