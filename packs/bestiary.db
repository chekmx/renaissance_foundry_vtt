Its head resembles that of a cockerel with a sharp beak (capable of injecting venom) and a crest and wattles. Apart from that, they are remarkably varied. Some have four legs ending in the claws of a cockerel, others have two legs, some are more snake-like and have no legs at all. Some have bat-like wings and some have bird-like wings, though all are believed to be flightless.</p>\n<p>Any close combat weapon hitting a basilisk loses one point of effectiveness for every point it inflicts on the creature. (e.g.. a sword that normally causes D8 damage will, after inflicting 3 points of damage to a basilisk, only be able to do D8-3 damage). If the weapon&rsquo;s damage reaches 0, it is destroyed. However, magical damage from a weapon (e.g. a sword with the spell For to Sharpen a Blade on it) will cause damage to the basilisk without being reflected, though the normal damage of the weapon will be. Ranged weapons are obviously not affected by this, though arrows, crossbow bolts and musket balls will be damaged in this way.</p>\n<p>The basilisk&rsquo;s poison and corrosive blood are magickal in nature, and lose their potency 1D3 minutes after leaving its body.

Some battlefields are said to be haunted by entire ghostly armies that appear to march and fight again quite regularly. Scenes of murder are often haunted by their victims, and people who have died with an important task left undone (particularly a task tied to the needs of their Faction in life) will often haunt the place of their death.</p>\n<p>Some ghosts appear to be harmless, merely repeating their last actions, or walking the same path over and over, accompanied by a chill in the air. But some ghosts can be more dangerous. Many can exhibit poltergeist activity, throwing objects at people nearby with sometimes lethal force. They can also make themselves visible or invisible at will, and when visible manifest as translucent figures.</p>\n<p>Ghosts are tied to the place of their death, and cannot move more than 10 x POW metres away from the spot.</p>\n<p>Ghosts can lift and throw objects equal to their POW x 2, and their Damage Modifier is also based on POW x 2.</p>\n<p>A ghost cannot be affected physically, but can be dismissed temporarily by someone with sufficient religious Righteousness. Any character who is a member of a suitable religious Faction may make an Opposed test of Righteousness against the ghost&rsquo;s Persistence while invoking God. This is a full-round action. On one level of&nbsp;Success, the ghost is dismissed for 3D6 days and cannot manifest again in that time. On two levels of Success, the ghost is dismissed permanently and will never manifest again. On a Failure, the ghost remains. On two levels of Failure, the character loses 2D6 Righteousness Points and is terrified for 3D6 Combat Rounds &ndash; he may try to get as far away from the ghost as possible, or curl up into a gibbering ball; if in combat, he may still defend himself, but cannot attack.</p>\n<p>The presence of a ghost can be detected with a successful Perception roll, even if the ghost is currently invisible &ndash; the character making the roll will feel a distinct chill and a feeling between the shoulder-blades that there is a presence nearby, though it will be impossible to tell exactly where. Someone who has never previously encountered a ghost will only feel spooked, whereas anyone who has previously encountered a ghost will recognise the presence immediately.</p>\n<p>A ghost who was an Alchemist or Witch before death can cast the spells it knew in life. Instead of spending Magic Points from a Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone, a ghostly Alchemist casting spells temporarily drains its POW. This POW is regained at 1 point per day for every day spent not manifesting. If POW reaches 0 the Ghost ceases to manifest, and cannot do so again until a point of POW has been regained (i.e. 24 hours later).</p>\n<p>Becoming invisible is a free action and is instantaneous. Because the ghost is incorporeal, it is undetectable when invisible, except by the &ldquo;creepy&rdquo; feeling given by a successful Perception roll.</p>\n<p>Ghosts are often confused and befuddled by their deaths. Consequently, although they retain any non-physical skills they had in life, they are at a -20% penalty to them. They can speak (in a ghostly whisper, usually, though sometimes in an eerie moan) but tend to be obsessive about their death and the reason for it &ndash; trying to have a rational conversation with a ghost is usually a waste of time.</p>"},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Ghost","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"qsMh8e3ICuynmdlg","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"MtuuG4HY7ukng7jU","name":"Persistance","type":"skill","data":{"description":"<p>Persistence is used whenever a character has his mental willpower called into question.
