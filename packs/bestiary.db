Its head resembles that of a cockerel with a sharp beak (capable of injecting venom) and a crest and wattles. Apart from that, they are remarkably varied. Some have four legs ending in the claws of a cockerel, others have two legs, some are more snake-like and have no legs at all. Some have bat-like wings and some have bird-like wings, though all are believed to be flightless.</p>\n<p>Any close combat weapon hitting a basilisk loses one point of effectiveness for every point it inflicts on the creature. (e.g.. a sword that normally causes D8 damage will, after inflicting 3 points of damage to a basilisk, only be able to do D8-3 damage). If the weapon&rsquo;s damage reaches 0, it is destroyed. However, magical damage from a weapon (e.g. a sword with the spell For to Sharpen a Blade on it) will cause damage to the basilisk without being reflected, though the normal damage of the weapon will be. Ranged weapons are obviously not affected by this, though arrows, crossbow bolts and musket balls will be damaged in this way.</p>\n<p>The basilisk&rsquo;s poison and corrosive blood are magickal in nature, and lose their potency 1D3 minutes after leaving its body. Some Alchemists have tried to find a way of &ldquo;fixing&rdquo; the poison, but so far with no success.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>BASILISKVENOM</p>\n<p>Type: Ingested or Contact</p>\n<p>Delay: Instant</p>\n<p>Potency: 65</p>\n<p>Effect: 1D4 damage, applies -6 penalty to victim&rsquo;s CON</p>\n<p>Duration: 6D10 minutes</p>","value":["60","30","60","71","40","40","30"]},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Basilisk","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"2Dn4OE8tGhhaNJra","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"4ziRaoprRVjKhzCO","name":"Light Armour","type":"armour","data":{"type":"LightArmour","points":2,"gunPoints":1},"sort":200000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.xwvyEuvCDN9V7WH9"}},"img":"buff-jerkin-of-hendrik-casimir-i-73e749.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"THTEadegaJN1c1KE","name":"Light Armour","type":"armour","data":{"type":"LightArmour","points":2,"gunPoints":1},"sort":200000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.xwvyEuvCDN9V7WH9"}},"img":"buff-jerkin-of-hendrik-casimir-i-73e749.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"bR6sn2bFevXMyhCM","name":"Bite","type":"weapon","data":{"skill":"30","size":"S","damage":"1d8","minimumStr":"","minimumDex":"","notes":"poison","range":"","load":"","encumberance":"","quantity":null,"weight":null},"sort":300000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"bR3ZawrpW3muzYFP","name":"Atheletics","type":"skill","data":{"description":"<p>This broad skill covers a range of athletic activities useful to Adventurers, including acrobatics, climbing, jumping and swimming.
